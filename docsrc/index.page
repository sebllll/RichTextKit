## Under Development

RichTextKit is still under development.  It works fine on Windows under net45 and 
netcoreapp2.1 but hasn't been tested on other platforms.

Also, text layout in general and Unicode and international text specifically are a 
complicated topics - almost certainly there are issues I'm unaware of and I'm 
hoping the community can help improve this project over time...

That said, RichTextKit certainly does a better job than Skia on its own.
